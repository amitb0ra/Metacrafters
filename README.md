### [ETH PROOF: Beginner EVM Course](https://academy.metacrafters.io/content/solidity-beginner)

Metacrafters connects crafters with opportunities, and there is no greater opportunity in web3 than Ethereum. This course will take you from basic coding knowledge to a beginner Solidity developer. You will learn about web3 and blockchains, dive into Ethereum and EVMs, and become a Solidity developer by reading and writing basic smart contracts. Upon completion, you will qualify for bounties and potential jobs in our talent collective. Solidity developers are in high demand in the blockchain industry, and this course will unlock new opportunities for you.

### [ETH + AVAX PROOF: Intermediate EVM Course](https://academy.metacrafters.io/content/solidity-avax-intermediate)

Solidity is the programming language that powers the Ethereum blockchain. In this course, we go beyond beginner knowledge of Solidity and help you learn key skills needed to work professionally with Solidity. You will be able to create decentralized applications (Dapps), connect them to wallets, build user interfaces, and explore Layer 2 (L2) blockchains by applying your knowledge to Avalanche. By learning how to use Solidity, EVMs, and Avalanche, you will be prepared for building smart contracts across chains and use cases. This course is perfect if you are ready to supercharge your Solidity knowledge and launch yourself into a new career. Earn your Proof of Learn NFT by completing this course and let us connect you with opportunities.

### [AVAX PROOF: Advanced Avalanche Course](https://academy.metacrafters.io/content/avax-advanced)

Avalanche Subnets are a powerful tool for building and managing decentralized applications within the Avalanche network, representing an important step forward in the evolution of blockchain technology. In this course, you will dive deep into the latest Avalanche features and learn how to create custom subnets using Go or Rust, deploy an EVM subnet, and deploy smart contracts onto it. You will also explore HyperSDK, a revolutionary framework that enables you to launch your own optimized subnet (Hyperchain) on Avalanche with ease. By the end of the course, you will be prepared to build and manage custom subnets quickly and easily. This advanced course is the perfect launchpad for a career building with Avalanche.

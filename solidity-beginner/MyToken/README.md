# Simple Token Contract

It is a simple token contract written in Solidity.

## Description

This Solidity contract represents a basic token implementation called ALPHA. It allows for the mint, burn, and tracking of tokens.

## Getting Started

### Installing

To use this code in Remix, follow these steps:

1. Open Remix in your web browser.
2. Create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the file explorer panel.
3. Copy and paste the code from the MyToken.sol file into the new file in Remix.
4. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., MyToken.sol).

### Executing program

1. In the Remix sidebar, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab.
2. Select the appropriate compiler version for your code.
3. Click on the "Compile" button to compile the code.
4. Once the code is successfully compiled, you can interact with the contract using the Remix interface.
5. Deploy the contract to the Ethereum network by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab.
6. Follow the instructions provided by Remix to deploy the contract.
7. After the contract is deployed, you can call the `mint` and `burn` functions to create and destroy tokens respectively.

Note: Make sure to have a compatible version of Solidity compiler selected in Remix and ensure that you have a valid Ethereum network connection for deployment and interaction with the contract.
